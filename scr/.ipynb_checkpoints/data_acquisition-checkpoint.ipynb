    "Now we will use the function written by Professor McDonald to make the ORES API request. He states, \"The API request will be made using a function to encapsulate call and make access reusable in other notebooks. The procedure is parameterized, relying on the constants above for some important default parameters. The primary assumption is that this function will be used to request data for a set of article revisions. The main parameter is 'article_revid'. One should be able to simply pass in a new article revision id on each call and get back a python dictionary as the result. A valid result will be a dictionary that contains the probabilities that the specific revision is one of six different article quality levels. Generally, quality level with the highest probability score is considered the quality level for the article. This can be tricky when you have two (or more) highly probable quality levels.\""
